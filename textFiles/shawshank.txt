1	INT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 

	A dark, empty room. 

	The door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and 
	giggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than 
	they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at 
	flesh, mouths locked together. 

	He gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over 
	instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like 
	getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She 
	arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against 
	the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. 

	He enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the 
	wall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not 
	caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with 
	the sensations running through her. He carries her across the 
	room with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed. 

	CAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling 
	smoothly outside... 

2	EXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2

	...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the 
	lovers' cries spilling into the night... 

	...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting 
	passion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of 
	crickets and hoot owls... 

	...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and
	incongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until... 

	...a car is revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked in a clearing. 

3	INT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3

	ANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit. 
	Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly
	dangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far 
	from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A 
	cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are 
	riveted to the bungalow up the path. 

	He can hear them fucking from here. 

	He raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio 
	plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: 

		You stepped out of a dream... 
		You are too wonderful... 
		To be what you seem... 

	He opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped
	in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully --

	-- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil. 

	He grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over 
	the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, 
	loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. 
	Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. 

	He shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant 
	lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then 
	opens the door and steps from the car. 

4	EXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4

	His wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to 
	the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. 

	He starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he 
	gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more 
	frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of 
	passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts. 

				WOMAN (O.S.) 
		Oh god...oh god...oh god... 

	Andy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in 
	orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He 
	shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. 

	It finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left 
	is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear 
	languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction. 

				WOMAN (O.S.) 
		Oh god...that's sooo good...you're 
		the best...the best I ever had... 

	Andy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like 
	much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt 
	path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun 
	held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really. 

	FADE TO BLACK: 1ST TITLE UP 

5	INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 5

	THE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, 
	pale-faced and stupefied. 

				D.A. (O.S.) 
		Mr. Dufresne, describe the 
		confrontation you had with your 
		wife the night she was murdered. 

	ANDY DUFRESNE 

	is on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, 
	hair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones: 

				ANDY 
		It was very bitter. She said she 
		was glad I knew, that she hated all 
		the sneaking around. She said she 
		wanted a divorce in Reno. 

				D.A. 
		What was your response? 

				ANDY 
		I told her I would not grant one. 

				D.A. 
			(refers to his notes) 
		I'll see you in Hell before I see
		you in Reno. Those were the words 
		you used, Mr. Dufresne, according 
		to the testimony of your neighbors. 

				ANDY 
		If they say so. I really don't 
		remember. I was upset. 

	FADE TO BLACK: 2ND TITLE UP 

				D.A. 
		What happened after you and your 
		wife argued? 

				ANDY 
		She packed a bag and went to stay 
		with Mr. Quentin. 

				D.A. 
		Glenn Quentin. The golf pro at the 
		Falmouth Hills Country Club. The 
		man you had recently discovered was 
		her lover. 
			(Andy nods) 
		Did you follow her? 

				ANDY 
		I went to a few bars first. Later, 
		I decided to drive to Mr. Quentin's 
		home and confront them. They 
		weren't there...so I parked my car 
		in the turnout...and waited. 

				D.A. 
		With what intention? 

				ANDY 
		I'm not sure. I was confused. Drunk. 
		I think mostly I wanted to scare them. 

				D.A. 
		You had a gun with you? 

				ANDY 
		Yes. I did. 

	FADE TO BLACK: 3RD TITLE UP 

				D.A. 
		When they arrived, you went up 
		to the house and murdered them? 

				ANDY 
		No. I was sobering up. I realized 
		she wasn't worth it. I decided to 
		let her have her quickie divorce. 

				D.A. 
		Quickie divorce indeed. A .38 
		caliber divorce, wrapped in a 
		handtowel to muffle the shots, 
		isn't that what you mean? And then 
		you shot her lover! 

				ANDY 
		I did not. I got back in the car 
		and drove home to sleep it off. 
		Along the way, I stopped and threw 
		my gun into the Royal River. I feel 
		I've been very clear on this point. 

				D.A. 
		Yes, you have. Where I get hazy, 
		though, is the part where the 
		cleaning woman shows up the next 
		morning and finds your wife and her 
		lover in bed, riddled with .38 
		caliber bullets. Does that strike 
		you as a fantastic coincidence, Mr. 
		Dufresne, or is it just me? 

				ANDY 
			(softly) 
		Yes. It does. 

				D.A. 
		I'm sorry, Mr. Dufresne, I don't 
		think the jury heard that. 

				ANDY 
		Yes. It does. 

				D.A. 
		Does what? 

				ANDY 
		Strike me as a fantastic coincidence. 

				D.A. 
		On that, sir, we are in accord... 

	FADE TO BLACK! 4TH TITLE UP 

				D.A. 
		You claim you threw your gun into 
		the Royal River before the murders 
		took place. That's rather convenient. 

				ANDY 
		It's the truth. 

				D.A. 
		You recall Lt. Mincher's testimony? 
		He and his men dragged that river 
		for three days and nary a gun was 
		found. So no comparison can be made 
		between your gun and the bullets 
		taken from the bloodstained corpses 
		of the victims. That's also rather 
		convenient, isn't it, Mr. Dufresne? 

				ANDY 
			(faint, bitter smile) 
		Since I am innocent of this crime, 
		sir, I find it decidedly inconvenient 
		the gun was never found. 

	FADE TO BLACK: STH TITLE UP 

6	INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 6

	The D.A. holds the jury spellbound with his closing summation:

				D.A. 
		Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard 
		all the evidence, you know all the 
		facts. We have the accused at the 
		scene of the crime. We have foot 
		prints. Tire tracks. Bullets 
		scattered on the ground which bear 
		his fingerprints. A broken bourbon 
		bottle, likewise with fingerprints. 
		Most of all, we have a beautiful 
		young woman and her lover lying 
		dead in each other's arms. They had 
		sinned. But was their crime so 
		great as to merit a death sentence? 

	He gestures to Andy sitting quietly with his ATTORNEY. 

				D.A. 
		I suspect Mr. Dufresne's answer to 
		that would be yes. I further 
		suspect he carried out that 
		sentence on the night of September 
		21st, this year of our Lord, 1946, 
		by pumping four bullets into his 
		wife and another four into Glenn 
		Quentin. And while you think about 
		that, think about this... 

	He picks up a revolver, spins the cylinder before their eyes 
	like a carnival barker spinning a wheel of fortune. 

				D.A. 
		A revolver holds six bullets, not 
		eight. I submit to you this was not 
		a hot-blooded crime of passion! 
		That could at least be understood, 
		if not condoned. No, this was 
		revenge of a much more brutal and 
		cold-blooded nature. Consider! Four 
		bullets per victim! Not six shots 
		fired, but eight! That means he 
		fired the gun empty...and then 
		stopped to reload so he could shoot 
		each of them again! An extra bullet 
		per lover...right in the head. 
			(a few JURORS shiver) 
		I'm done talking. You people are 
		all decent, God-fearing Christian 
		folk. You know what to do. 

	FADE TO BLACK: 6TH TITLE UP 

7	INT -- JURY ROOM -- DAY (1946) 7

	CAMERA TRACKS down a long table, moving from one JUROR to the 
	next. These decent, God-fearing Christians are chowing down on 
	a nice fried chicken dinner provided them by the county, 
	smacking greasy lips and gnawing cobbettes of corn. 

				VOICE (O.S.) 
		Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty... 

	We find the FOREMAN at the head of the table, sorting votes. 

	FADE TO BLACK: 7TH TITLE UP 

8	INT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 8

	Andy stands before the dias. THE JUDGE peers down, framed by a 
	carved frieze of blind Lady Justice on the wall. 

				JUDGE 
		You strike me as a particularly icy 
		and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. 
		It chills my blood just to look at 
		you. By the power vested in me by 
		the State of Maine, I hereby order 
		you to serve two life sentences, 
		back to back, one for each of your 
		victims. So be it. 

	He raps his gavel as we 

	CRASH TO BLACK: LAST TITLE UP. 

9 	AN IRON-BARRED DOOR 9

	slides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room waits beyond.
	CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit side by side at
	a long table. An empty chair faces them. We are now in: 

	INT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1947) 

	RED enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair. 

				MAN #1 
		Sit. 

	Red sits, tries not to slouch. The chair is uncomfortable. 

				MAN #2 
		We see by your file you've served 
		twenty years of a life sentence. 

				MAN #3 
		You feel you've been rehabilitated? 

				RED 
		Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned 
		my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a 
		changed man. I'm no longer a danger 
		to society. That's the God's honest 
		truth. No doubt about it. 

	The men just stare at him. One stifles a yawn. 

	CLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM 

	A big rubber stamp slams down: "REJECTED" in red ink. 

10	EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DUSK (1947) 10

	High stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at
	intervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are 
	in the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each 
	other, making deals. Exercise period. 



	RED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the 
	activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing 
	minor business. He's an important man here. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		There's a con like me in every prison 
		in America, I guess. I'm the guy who 
		can get it for you. Cigarettes, a 
		bag of reefer if you're partial, a 
		bottle of brandy to celebrate your 
		kid's high school graduation. Damn 
		near anything, within reason. 

	He slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand.

				RED (V.O.) 
		Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears & 
		Roebuck. 

	TWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing 
	everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate 
	swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 
		1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita 
		Hayworth into the prison for him, I 
		told him no problem. And it wasn't. 

				CON 
		Fresh fish! Fresh fish today! 

	Red is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. 
	Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his 
	group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably. 

11	INT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1947) 11

	Andy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy came to Shawshank Prison in 
		early 1947 for murdering his wife 
		and the fella she was bangin'. 

	The bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes 
	around, swallowed by prison walls. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		On the outside, he'd been vice- 
		president of a large Portland bank. 
		Good work for a man as young as he 
		was, when you consider how 
		conservative banks were back then. 

				TOWER GUARD 
		All clear! 

	GUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. 
	The new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking 
	sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in 
	front of him, almost drags him down. 

	BYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into 
	Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS 
	and SHOUTS from the spectators. 

				HADLEY 
		On your feet before I fuck you up 
		so bad you never walk again. 

13 	ON THE BLEACHERS 13

				RED 
		There they are, boys. The Human 
		Charm Bracelet. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Never seen such a sorry-lookin' 
		heap of maggot shit in my life. 

				JIGGER 
		Comin' from you, Heywood, you being 
		so pretty and all... 

				FLOYD 
		Takin' bets today, Red? 

				RED 
			(pulls notepad and pencil) 
		Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? 
		Smokes or coin, bettor's choice. 

				FLOYD 
		Smokes. Put me down for two. 

				RED 
		High roller. Who's your horse? 

				FLOYD 
		That gangly sack of shit, third 
		from the front. He'll be the first. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Bullshit. I'll take that action. 

				ERNIE 
		Me too. 

	Other hands go up. Red jots the names. 

				HEYWOOD 
		You're out some smokes, son. Take 
		my word. 

				FLOYD 
		You're so smart, you call it. 

				HEYWOOD 
		I say that chubby fat-ass...let's 
		see...fifth from the front. Put me 
		down for a quarter deck. 

				RED 
		That's five cigarettes on Fat-Ass. 
		Any takers? 

	More hands go up. Andy and the others are paraded along, 
	forced by their chains to take tiny baby steps, flinching 
	under the barrage of jeers and shouts. The old-timers are 
	shaking the fence, trying to make the newcomers shit their 
	pants. Some of the new fish shout back, but mostly they look 
	terrified. Especially Andy. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I must admit I didn't think much of 
		Andy first time I laid eyes on him. 
		He might'a been important on the 
		outside, but in here he was just a 
		little turd in prison grays. Looked 
		like a stiff breeze could blow him 
		over. That was my first impression 
		of the man. 

				SKEET 
		What say, Red? 

				RED 
		Little fella on the end. Definitely. 
		I stake half a pack. Any takers? 

				SNOOZE 
		Rich bet. 

				RED 
		C'mon, boys, who's gonna prove me 
		wrong? 
			(hands go up) 
		Floyd, Skeet, Joe, Heywood. Four brave 
		souls, ten smokes apiece. That's it, 
		gentlemen, this window's closed. 

	Red pockets his notepad. A VOICE comes over the P.A. speakers:

				VOICE (amplified) 
		Return to your cellblocks for 
		evening count. 

14	INT -- ADMITTING AREA -- DUSK (1947) 14

	The new fish are marched in. Guards unlock the shackles. The
	chains drop away, rattling to the stone floor. 

				HADLEY 
		Eyes front. 

	WARDEN SAMUEL NORTON strolls forth, a colorless man in a gray
	suit and a church pin in his lapel. He looks like he could 
	piss ice water. He appraises the newcomers with flinty eyes.

				NORTON 
		This is Mr. Hadley, captain of the 
		guard. I am Mr. Norton, the warden. 
		You are sinners and scum, that's 
		why they sent you to me. Rule 
		number one: no blaspheming. I'll 
		not have the Lord's name taken in 
		vain in my prison. The other rules 
		you'll figure out as you go along. 
		Any questions? 

				CON 
		When do we eat? 

	Cued by Norton's glance, Hadley steps up to the con and screams
	right in his face: 

				HADLEY 
		YOU EAT WHEN WE SAY YOU EAT! YOU 
		PISS WHEN WE SAY YOU PISS! YOU SHIT 
		WHEN WE SAY YOU SHIT! YOU SLEEP 
		WHEN WE SAY YOU SLEEP! YOU MAGGOT- 
		DICK MOTHERFUCKER! 

	Hadley rams the tip of his club into the con's belly. The 
	man falls to his knees, gasping and clutching himself. 
	Hadley takes his place at Norton's side again. Softly: 

				NORTON 
		Any other questions? 
			(there are none) 
		I believe in two things. Discipline 
		and the Bible. Here, you'll receive 
		both. 
			(holds up a Bible) 
		Put your faith in the Lord. Your 
		ass belongs to me. Welcome to 
		Shawshank. 

				HADLEY 
		Off with them clothes! And I didn't 
		say take all day doing it, did I? 

	The men shed their clothes. Within seconds, all stand naked. 

				HADLEY 
		First man into the shower! 

	Hadley shoves the FIRST CON into a steel cage open at the 
	front. TWO GUARDS open up with a fire hose. The con is slammed 
	against the back of the cage, sputtering and hollering. 
	Seconds later, the water is cut and the con yanked out. 

				HADLEY 
		Delouse that piece of shit! Next 
		man in! 

	The con gets a huge scoop of white delousing powder thrown all
	over him. Gasping and coughing, blinking powder from his eyes,
	he gets shoved to a trustee's cage. The TRUSTEE slides a short
	stack of items through the slot -- prison clothes and a Bible.
	All the men are processed quickly -- a blast of water, powder,
	clothes and a Bible... 

15	INT -- INFIRMARY -- NIGHT (1947) 15

	A naked CON steps before a DOCTOR and gets a cursory exam. 
	A penlight is shined in his eyes, ears, nose, and throat. 

				DOCTOR 
		Bend over. 

	The con does. A GUARD with a penlight in his teeth spreads his 
	cheeks, peers up his ass, and nods. Andy is next up. He gets 
	the same treatment. 


16	INT -- PRISON CHAPEL -- NIGHT (1947) 16

	CAMERA TRACKS the naked newcomers shivering on hard wooden 
	chairs, clothes on their laps, Bibles open. 

				CHAPLAIN (O.S.) 
		...maketh me to lie down in green 
		pastures. He leadeth me beside the 
		still waters. He restoreth my soul... 

17	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 17

	Three tiers to a side, concrete and steel, gray and imposing. 
	Andy and the others are marched in, still naked, carrying 
	their clothes and Bibles. The CONS in their cells greet them 
	with TAUNTS, JEERS, and LAUGHTER. One by one, the new men are 
	shown to their cells and locked in with a CLANG OF STEEL. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		The first night's the toughest, no 
		doubt about it. They march you in 
		naked as the day you're born, fresh 
		from a Bible reading, skin burning 
		and half-blind from that delousing 
		shit they throw on you... 

	Red watches from his cell, arms slung over the crossbars, 
	cigarette dangling from his fingers. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...and when they put you in that 
		cell, when those bars slam home, 
		that's when you know it's for real. 
		Old life blown away in the blink of 
		an eye...a long cold season in hell 
		stretching out ahead...nothing 
		left but all the time in the world 
		to think about it. 

	Red listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few 
	others being brought up to the 2nd tier. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Most new fish come close to madness 
		the first night. Somebody always 
		breaks down crying. Happens every 
		time. The only question is, who's 
		it gonna be? 

	Andy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		It's as good a thing to bet on as 
		any, I guess. I had my money on 
		Andy Dufresne... 

18	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 18

	The bars slam home. Andy is alone in his cell, clutching his 
	clothes. He gazes around at his new surroundings, taking it 
	in. He slowly begins to dress himself... 

19	EXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- NIGHT (1947) 19

	A malignant stone growth on the Maine landscape. The moon 
	hangs low and baleful in a dead sky. The headlight of a 
	PASSING TRAIN cuts through the night. 

20	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 20

	Red lies on his bunk below us, tossing his baseball toward the 
	ceiling and catching it again. He pauses, listening. FOOTSTEPS 
	approach below, unhurried, echoing hollowly on stone. 

21	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 21

	LOW ANGLE. A CELLBLOCK GUARD strolls into frame. 

				GUARD 
		That's lights out! Good night, ladies. 

	The lights bump off in sequence. The guard exits, footsteps
	echoing away. Darkness now. Silence. CAMERA CRANES UP the 
	tiers toward Red's cell. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I remember my first night. Seems a 
		long time ago now. 

	Red looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. Listens. 
	Waits. From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering.
	VOICES drift through the cellblock, taunting: 

				VARIOUS VOICES (O.S.) 
		Fishee fishee fisheeee...You're 
		gonna like it here, new fish. A 
		whooole lot...Make you wish your 
		daddies never dicked your 
		mommies...You takin' this down, new 
		fish? Gonna be a quiz later. 
			(somebody LAUGHS) 
		Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws'll 
		hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee... 

				RED (V.O.) 
		The boys always go fishin' with 
		first-timers...and they don't quit 
		till they reel someone in. 

	The VOICES keep on, sly and creepy in the dark... 

22	INT -- VARIOUS CELLS -- NIGHT (1947) 22
	thru thru 25
	2g ...while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells. One man
	paces like a caged animal...another sits gnawing his cuticles
	bloody...a third is weeping silently...a fourth is dry-heaving
	into the toilet... 

26	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 26

	Red waits at the bars. Smoking. Listening. He cranes his head,
	peers down toward Andy's cell. Nothing. Not a peep. 

				HEYWOOD (O.S.) 
		Fat-Ass...oh, Faaaat-Ass. Talk to 
		me, boy. I know you're in there. I 
		can hear you breathin'. Now don't 
		you listen to these nitwits, hear? 

27	INT -- FAT-ASS' CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 27

	Fat-Ass is crying, trying not to hyperventilate. 

				HEYWOOD (O.S.) 
		This ain't such a bad place. I'll 
		introduce you around, make you feel 
		right at home. I know some big ol' 
		bull queers who'd love to make your 
		acquaintance...especially that big 
		white mushy butt of yours... 

	And that's it. Fat-Ass lets out a LOUD WAIL of despair: 

				FAT-ASS 
		OH GOD! I DON'T BELONG HERE! I 
		WANNA GO HOME! 

28	INT -- HEYWOOD'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 28

				HEYWOOD 
		AND IT'S FAT-ASS BY A NOSE.' 

29	INT -- CELLBLOCK -- NIGHT (1947) 29

	The place goes nuts. Fat-Ass throws himself screaming against
	the bars. The entire block starts CHANTING: 

				VOICES 
		Fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh 
		fish...fresh fish... 

				FAT-ASS 
		I WANNA GO HOME! I WANT MY MOTHER.' 

				VOICE (O.S.) 
		I had your mother! She wasn't that 
		great! 

	The lights bump on. GUARDS pour in, led by Hadley himself.

				HADLEY 
		What the Christ is this happy shit? 

				VOICE (O.S.) 
		He took the Lord's name in vain! 
		I'm tellin' the warden! 

				HADLEY 
			(to the unseen wit) 
		You'll be tellin' him with my baton 
		up your ass! 

	Hadley arrives at Fat-Ass' cell, bellowing through the bars:

				HADLEY 
		What's your malfunction you fat 
		fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk? 

				FAT-ASS 
		PLEASE! THIS AIN'T RIGHT! I AIN'T 
		SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! NOT ME! 

				HADLEY 
		I ain't gonna count to three! Not 
		even to one! Now shut the fuck up 
		'fore I sing you a lullabye! 

	Fat-Ass keeps blubbering and wailing. Total freak-out. Hadley 
	draws his baton, gestures to his men. Open it. 

	A GUARD unlocks the cell. Hadley pulls Fat-Ass out and starts 
	beating him with the baton, brutally raining blows. Fat-Ass 
	falls, tries to crawl. 

	The place goes dead silent. All we hear now is the dull
	THWACK-THWACK-THWACK of the baton. Fat-ass passes out. Hadley
	gets in a few more licks and finally stops. 

				HADLEY 
		Get this tub of shit down to the 
		infirmary. 
			(peers around) 
		If I hear so much as a mouse fart 
		in here the rest of the night, by 
		God and Sonny Jesus, you'll all 
		visit the infirmary. Every last 
		motherfucker here. 

	The guards wrestle Fat-Ass onto a stretcher and carry him off. 
	FOOTSTEPS echo away. Lights off. Darkness again. Silence. 

30	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 30

	Red stares through the bars at the main floor below, eyes 
	riveted to the small puddle of blood where Fat-Ass went down. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		His first night in the joint, Andy 
		Dufresne cost me two packs of 
		cigarettes. He never made a sound... 

31	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1947) 31

	LOUD BUZZER. The master locks are thrown -- KA-THUMP! The cons 
	step from their cells, lining the tiers. The GUARDS holler 
	their head-counts to the HEAD BULL, who jots on a clipboard. 
	Red peers at Andy, checking him out. Andy stands in line, 
	collar buttoned, hair combed. 

32	INT -- MESS HALL -- MORNING (1947) 32

	Andy goes through the breakfast line, gets a scoop of glop on
	his tray. WE PAN ANDY through the noise and confusion...and 
	discover BOGS DIAMOND and ROOSTER MacBRIDE watching Andy go 
	by. Bogs sizes Andy up with a salacious gleam in his eye, 
	mutters something to Rooster. Rooster laughs. 

	Andy finds a table occupied by Red and his regulars, chooses
	a spot at the end where nobody is sitting. Ignoring their 
	stares, he picks up his spoon -- and pauses, seeing something
	in his food. He carefully fishes it out with his fingers. 

	It's a squirming maggot. Andy grimaces, unsure what to do with
	it. BROOKS HATLEN is sitting closest to Andy. At age 65, he's
	a senior citizen, a long-standing resident. 

				BROOKS 
		You gonna eat that? 

				ANDY 
		Hadn't planned on it. 

				BROOKS 
		You mind? 

	Andy passes the maggot to Brooks. Brooks examines it, rolling
	it between his fingertips like a man checking out a fine 
	cigar. Andy is riveted with apprehension. 

				BROOKS 
		Mmm. Nice and ripe. 

	Andy can't bear to watch. Brooks opens up his sweater and 
	feeds the maggot to a baby crow nestled in an inside pocket.
	Andy breathes a sigh of relief. 

				BROOKS 
		Jake says thanks. Fell out of his 
		nest over by the plate shop. I'm 
		lookin' after him till he's old 
		enough to fly. 

	Andy nods, proceeds to eat. Carefully. Heywood approaches.

				JIGGER 
		Oh, Christ, here he comes. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Mornin', boys. It's a fine mornin'. 
		You know why it's fine? 

	Heywood plops his tray down, sits. The men start pulling out
	cigarettes and handing them down. 

				HEYWOOD 
		That's right, send 'em all down. I 
		wanna see 'em lined up in a row, 
		pretty as a chorus line. 

	An impressive pile forms. Heywood bends down and inhales
	deeply, smelling the aroma. Rapture. 

				FLOYD 
		Smell my ass... 

				HEYWOOD 
		Gee, Red. Terrible shame, your 
		horse comin' in last and all. 
		Hell, I sure do love that horse of 
		mine. I believe I owe that boy a 
		big sloppy kiss when I see him. 

				RED 
		Give him some'a your cigarettes 
		instead, cheap bastard. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Say Tyrell, you pull infirmary duty 
		this week? How's that winnin' horse 
		of mine, anyway? 

				TYRELL 
		Dead. 
			(the men fall silent) 
		Hadley busted his head pretty good. 
		Doc already went home for the 
		night. Poor bastard lay there till 
		this morning. By then... 

	He shakes his head, turns back to his food. The silence
	mounts. Heywood glances around. Men resume eating. Softly:

				ANDY 
		What was his name? 

				HEYWOOD 
		What? What'd you say? 

				ANDY 
		I was wondering if anyone knew his 
		name. 

				HEYWOOD 
		What the fuck you care, new fish? 
			(resumes eating) 
		Doesn't matter what his fuckin' 
		name was. He's dead. 

33	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 33

	A DEAFENING NOISE of industrial washers and presses. Andy works
	the laundry line. A nightmarish job. He's new at it. BOB, the
	con foreman, elbows him aside and shows him how it's done. 

34	INT -- SHOWERS -- DAY (1947) 34

	Shower heads mounted in bare concrete. Andy showers with a
	dozen or more men. No modesty here. At least the water is good
	and hot, soothing his tortured muscles. 

	Bogs looms from the billowing steam, smiling, checking Andy up
	and down. Rooster and PETE appear from the sides. The Sisters.

				BOGS 

	You're some sweet punk. You been 
	broke in yet? 

	Andy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing
	serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey.

				BOGS 
		Hard to get. I like that. 

	Andy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving
	the three Sisters laughing. 

35	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 35

	Andy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep. 

36	EXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36

	Exercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, 
	lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the
	side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. 
	Heywood and Jigger pause, watching. 

				ANDY 
			(offers his hand) 
		Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne. 

	Red glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues.

				RED 
		The wife-killin' banker. 

				ANDY 
		How do you know that? 

				RED 
		I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd 
		you do it? 

				ANDY 
		I didn't, since you ask. 

				RED 
		Hell, you'll fit right in, then. 
			(off Andy's look) 
		Everyone's innocent in here, don't 
		you know that? Heywood! What are 
		you in for, boy? 

				HEYWOOD 
		Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! 

	Red gives Andy a look. See? 

				ANDY 
		What else have you heard? 

				RED 
		People say you're a cold fish. They 
		say you think your shit smells 
		sweeter than ordinary. That true? 


				ANDY 
		What do you think? 

				RED 
		Ain't made up my mind yet. 

	Heywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the
	ball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of
	the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends
	the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood
	drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. 

				ANDY 
		I understand you're a man who knows 
		how to get things. 

				RED 
		I'm known to locate certain things 
		from time to time. They seem to 
		fall into my hands. Maybe it's 
		'cause I'm Irish. 

				ANDY 
		I wonder if you could get me a 
		rock-hammer? 

				RED 
		What is it and why? 

				ANDY 
		You make your customers' motives a 
		part of your business? 


				RED 
		If you wanted a toothbrush, I 
		wouldn't ask questions. I'd just 
		quote a price. A toothbrush, see, 
		is a non-lethal sort of object. 

				ANDY 
		Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about 
		eight or nine inches long. Looks 
		like a miniature pickaxe, with a 
		small sharp pick on one end, and a 
		blunt hammerhead on the other. It's 
		for rocks. 

				RED 
		Rocks. 

	Andy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of
	dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and
	rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red.

				RED 
		Quartz? 

				ANDY 
		Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. 
		Silted granite. There's some graded 
		limestone, from when they cut this 
		place out of the hill. 

				RED 
		So? 

				ANDY 
		I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in 
		my old life. I'd like to be again, 
		on a limited scale. 

				RED 
		Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy 
		in somebody's skull? 

				ANDY 
		I have no enemies here. 

				RED 
		No? Just wait. 

	Red flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them. 

				RED 
		Word gets around. The Sisters have 
		taken a real shine to you, yes they 
		have. Especially Bogs. 

				ANDY 
		Tell me something. Would it help if 
		I explained to them I'm not 
		homosexual? 

				RED 
		Neither are they. You have to be 
		human first. They don't qualify. 
			(off Andy's look) 
		Bull queers take by force, that's 
		all they want or understand. I'd 
		grow eyes in the back of my head if 
		I were you. 

				ANDY 
		Thanks for the advice. 

				RED 
		That comes free. But you understand 
		my concern. 

				ANDY 
		If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- 
		hammer will do me any good. 

				RED 
		Then I guess you wanna escape. 
		Tunnel under the wall maybe? 
			(Andy laughs politely) 
		I miss the joke. What's so funny? 

				ANDY 

	You'll know when you see the rock- 
	hammer. 

				RED 
		What's this item usually go for? 

				ANDY 
		Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

				RED 
		My standard mark-up's twenty 
		percent, but we're talkin' about a 
		special object. Risk goes up, price 
		goes up. Call it ten bucks even. 

				ANDY 
		Ten it is. 

				RED 
		I'll see what I can do. 
			(rises, slapping dust) 
		But it's a waste of money. 

				ANDY 
		Oh? 

				RED 
		Folks who run this place love 
		surprise inspections. They turn a 
		blind eye to some things, but not 
		a gadget like that. They'll find 
		it, and you'll lose it. Mention my 
		name, we'll never do business 
		again. Not for a pair of shoelaces 
		or a stick of gum. 

				ANDY 
		I understand. Thank you, Mr...? 

				RED 
		Red. The name's Red. 

				ANDY 
		Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing 
		business with you. 

	They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I could see why some of the boys 
		took him for snobby. He had a quiet 
		way about him, a walk and a talk 
		that just wasn't normal around 
		here. He strolled. like a man in a 
		park without a care or worry. Like 
		he had on an invisible coat that 
		would shield him from this place. 
			(resumes playing catch) 
		Yes, I think it would be fair to 
		say I liked Andy from the start. 

37	INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1947) 37

	Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table. Andy falls in
	step, slips him a tightly-folded square of paper. 

38	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 38

	Lying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square. A ten dollar bill.

				RED (V.O.) 
		He was a man who adapted fast. 

39	EXT -- LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1947) 39

	Under watchful supervision, CONS are off-loading bags of dirty
	laundry from an "Eliot Nursing Home" truck. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Years later, I found out he'd 
		brought in quite a bit more than 
		just ten dollars... 

	A certain bag hits the ground. The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look 
	at a black con, LEONARD, then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot 
	the shit. Leonard loads the bag onto a cart... 

40	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 40

	Bags are being unloaded. We find Leonard working the line. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		When they check you into this 
		hotel, one of the bellhops bends 
		you over and looks up your works, 
		just to make sure you're not 
		carrying anything. But a truly 
		determined man can get an object 
		quite a ways up there. 

	Leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry 
	bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting... 

4l	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41

	Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where 
	the clean sheets are being handed out. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		That's how Andy joined our happy 
		little Shawshank family with more 
		than five hundred dollars on his 
		person. Determination. 

	Leonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of 
	clean sheets. He hands it across to Red -- 

	TIGHT ANGLE 

	-- and more than clean laundry changes hands. Two packs of
	cigarettes slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's. 

42	INT -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1947) 42

	Red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to 
	make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. He pulls out the 
	rock-hammer. It's just as Andy described. Red laughs softly. 
43	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1947) 43

	Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. The 
	rolling library. He finds Red waiting for him. Red slips the 
	rock-hammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the
	cart. Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage. 

				RED 

	Dufresne. 

	Brooks nods, never missing a beat. He rolls his cart to 
	Andy's cell, mutters through the bars: 

				BROOKS 
		Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel. 

	Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object 
	disappear. The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of 
	folded paper along with more cigarettes. Brooks turns his cart
	around and goes back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough
	for Red to snag the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, 
	scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket. 

44	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 44

	Red unfolds the slip of paper. Penciled neatly on it is a 
	single word: "Thanks." 

45	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 45

	We are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line. 
	Andy is doing his job, getting good at it. 

				BOB 
		DUFRESNE! WE'RE LOW ON HEXLITE! 
		HEAD ON BACK AND FETCH US UP SOME! 

	Andy nods. He leaves the line, weaving his way through the 
	laundry room and into -- 

46	INT -- BACK ROOMS/STOCK AREA -- DAY (1947) 46

	-- a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and
	furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of 
	cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. Andy hefts a 
	cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack, turns around -- 

	-- and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle. blocking his way.
	Rooster looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness
	on the left. A frozen beat. Andy slams the Hexlite to the
	floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful.

				ANDY 
		You get this in your eyes, it 
		blinds you. 

				BOGS 
		Honey, hush. 

	Andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through 
	the maze. The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes 
	riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. 
	Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. That's all it takes. 
	They're on him in an instant, kicking and stomping. 

	Andy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from 
	behind. They propel him across the room and slam him against 
	an old four-pocket machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams 
	a rag into Andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like 
	a horse bit. Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete 
	have his arms firmly pinned. Bogs whispers in Andy's ear: 

				BOGS 
		That's it, fight. Better that way. 

	Andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. CAMERA PULLS BACK, 
	SLOWLY WIDENING. The big Washex blocks our view. All we see 
	is Andy's screaming face and the men holding him down... 

	...and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM, leaving the dark place 
	and the dingy act behind...MOVING up empty corridors, past 
	concrete walls and steel pipes... 

				RED (V.O.) 
		I wish I could tell you that Andy 
		fought the good fight, and the 
		Sisters let him be. I wish I could 
		tell you that, but prison is no 
		fairy-tale world. 

	WE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard, WIDENING for 
	a final view of the line. The giant steel "mangler" is 
	slapping down in brutal rhythm. The sound is deafening. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		He never said who did it...but we 
		all knew. 

	PRISON MONTAGE: (1947 through 1949) 

47 	ANDY PLODS THROUGH HIS DAYS. WORKING. EATING. CHIPPING AND 47
	shaping his rocks after lights-out... 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Things went on like that for a 
		while. Prison life consists of 
		routine, and then more routine. 

48 	ANDY WALKS THE YARD, FACE SWOLLEN AND BRUISED. 48 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Every so often, Andy would show up 
		with fresh bruises. 

49 	ANDY EATS BREAKFAST. A FEW TABLES OVER, BOGS BLOWS HIM A KISS. 49

				RED (V.O.) 
		The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes 
		he was able to fight them off... 
		sometimes not. 

50 	ANDY BACKS INTO A CORNER IN SOME DINGY PART OF THE PRISON, 
	wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		He always fought, that's what I 
		remember. He fought because he knew 
		if he didn't fight, it would make 
		it that much easier not to fight 
		the next time. 

	The rake connects, snapping off over somebody's skull. They 
	beat the hell out of him. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Half the time it landed him in the 
		infirmary... 


51	INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ("THE HOLE") -- NIGHT (1949) 51 

	A stone closet. No bed, sink, or lights. Just a toilet with no 
	seat. Andy sits on bare concrete, bruised face lit by a faint 
	ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...the other half, it landed him in 
		solitary. Warden Norton's "grain & 
		drain" vacation. Bread, water, and 
		all the privacy you could want. 

52	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1949) 52

	Andy is working the line. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		And that's how it went for Andy. That 
		was his routine. I do believe those 
		first two years were the worst for 
		him. And I also believe if things 
		had gone on that way, this place 
		would have got the best of him. 
		But then, in the spring of 1949, 
		the powers-that-be decided that... 

53	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 53

	Warden Norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn: 

				NORTON 
		...the roof of the license-plate 
		factory needs resurfacing. I need a 
		dozen volunteers for a week's work. 
		We're gonna be taking names in this 
		steel bucket here... 

	Red glances around at his friends. Andy also catches his eye.

				RED (V.O.) 
		It was outdoor detail, and May is 
		one damn fine month to be workin' 
		outdoors. 

54	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 54

	Cons shuffle past, dropping slips of paper into a bucket. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		More than a hundred men volunteered 
		for the job. 

	Red saunters to a guard named TIM YOUNGBLOOD, mutters 
	discreetly in his ear. 

55	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 55

	Youngblood is pulling names and reading them off. Red 
	exchanges grins with Andy and the others. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Wouldn't you know it? Me and some 
		fellas I know were among the names 
		called. 

56	INT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 56

	Red slips Youngblood six packs of cigarettes. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Only cost us a pack of smokes per 
		man. I made my usual twenty 
		percent, of course. 

57	EXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 57

	A tar-cooker bubbles and smokes. TWO CONS dip up a bucket of
	tar and tie a rope to the handle. The rope goes taught. CAMERA
	FOLLOWS the bucket of tar up the side of the building to -- 

58 	THE ROOF 58

	-- where it is relayed to the work detail. the men are dipping
	big Padd brushes and spreading the tar. ANGLZ OVER to Byron 
	Hadley bitching sourly to his fellow guards: 

				HADLEY 
		...so this shithead lawyer calls 
		long distance from Texas, and he 
		says, Byron Hadley? I say, yeah. He 
		says, sorry to inform you, but your 
		brother just died. 

				YOUNGBLOOD 
		Damn, Byron. Sorry to hear that. 

				HADLEY 
		I ain't. He was an asshole. Run off 
		years ago, family ain't heard of him 
		since. Figured him for dead anyway. 
		So this lawyer prick says, your 
		brother died a rich man. Oil wells 
		and shit, close to a million bucks. 
		Jesus, it's frigging incredible how 
		lucky some assholes can get. 

				TROUT 
		A million bucks? Jeez-Louise! You 
		get any of that? 

				HADLEY 
		Thirty five thousand. That's what 
		he left me. 

				TROUT 
		Dollars? Holy shit, that's great! 
		Like winnin' a lottery... 
			(off Hadley's shitty look) 
		...ain't it? 

				HADLEY 
		Dumbshit. What do you figger the 
		government's gonna do to me? Take a 
		big wet bite out of my ass, is what. 

				TROUT 
		Oh. Hadn't thought of that. 

				HADLEY 
		Maybe leave me enough to buy a new 
		car with. Then what happens? You 
		pay tax on the car. Repairs and 
		maintenance. Goddamn kids pesterin' 
		you to take 'em for a ride... 

				MERT 
		And drive it, if they're old enough. 

				HADLEY 
		That's right, wanting to drive it, 
		wanting to learn on it, f'Chrissake! 
		Then at the end of the year, if you 
		figured the tax wrong, they make 
		you pay out of your own pocket. 
		Uncle Sam puts his hand in your 
		shirt and squeezes your tit till 
		it's purple. Always get the short 
		end. That's a fact. 
			(spits over the side) 
		Some brother. Shit. 

	The prisoners keep spreading tar, eyes on their work. 

				HEYWOOD 
		Poor Byron. What terrible fuckin' 
		luck. Imagine inheriting thirty 
		five thousand dollars. 

				RED 
		Crying shame. Some folks got it 
		awful bad. 

	Red glances over -- and is shocked to see Andy standing up,
	listening to the guards talk. 

				RED 
		Hey, you nuts? Keep your eyes on 
		your pail! 

	Andy tosses his Padd in the bucket and strolls toward Hadley.

				RED 
		Andy! Come back! Shit! 

				SNOOZE 
		What's he doing? 

				FLOYD 
		Gettin' himself killed. 

				RED 
		God damn it... 

				HEYWOOD 
		Just keep spreadin' tar... 

	The guards stiffen at Andy's approach. Youngblood's hand goes
	to his holster. The tower guards CLICK-CLACK their rifle 
	bolts. Hadley turns, stupefied to find Andy there. 

				ANDY 
		Mr. Hadley. Do you trust your wife? 

				HADLEY 
		That's funny. You're gonna look 
		funnier suckin' my dick with no 
		fuckin' teeth. 

				ANDY 
		What I mean is, do you think she'd 
		go behind your back? Try to 
		hamstring you? 

				HADLEY 
		That's it! Step aside, Mert. This 
		fucker's havin' hisself an accident. 

	Hadley grabs Andy's collar and propels him violently toward
	the edge of the roof. The cons furiously keep spreading tar.

				HEYWOOD 
		Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's 
		gonna throw him off the roof... 

				SNOOZE 
		Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus... 

				ANDY 
		Because if you do trust her, there's 
		no reason in the world you can't 
		keep every cent of that money. 

	Hadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge. In 
	fact, Andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips 
	scraping the roof. The only thing between him and an ugly drop
	to the concrete is Hadley's grip on the front of his shirt.

				HADLEY 
		You better start making sense. 

				ANDY 
		If you want to keep that money, all 
		of it, just give it to your wife. 
		See, the IRS allows you a one-time- 
		only gift to your spouse. It's good 
		up to sixty thousand dollars. 

				HADLEY 
		Naw, that ain't right! Tax free? 

				ANDY 
		Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent. 

	The cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion.

				HADLEY 
		You're the smart banker what shot 
		his wife. Why should I believe a 
		smart banker like you? So's I can 
		wind up in here with you? 

				ANDY 
		It's perfectly legal. Go ask the 
		IRS, they'll say the same thing. 
		Actually, I feel silly telling you 
		all this. I'm sure you would have 
		investigated the matter yourself. 

				HADLEY 
		Fuckin'-A. I don't need no smart 
		wife-killin' banker to show me where 
		the bear shit in the buckwheat. 

				ANDY 
		Of course not. But you will need 
		somebody to set up the tax-free 
		gift, and that'll cost you. A 
		lawyer, for example... 

				HADLEY 
		Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing 
		cocksuckers! 

				ANDY 
		...or come to think of it, I 
		suppose I could set it up for you. 
		That would save you some money. 
		I'll write down the forms you need, 
		you can pick them up, and I'll 
		prepare them for your signature... 
		nearly free of charge. 
			(off Hadley's look) 
		I'd only ask three beers apiece for 
		my co-workers, if that seems fair. 

				TROUT 
			(guffawing) 
		Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, 
		ain't it? Co-workers... 

	Hadley freezes him with a look. Andy presses on: 

				ANDY 
		I think a nan working outdoors 
		feels more like a man if he can 
		have a bottle of suds. That's only 
		my opinion. 

	The convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. They
	look like they've been pole-axed. Hadley shoots them a look.

				HADLEY 
		What are you jimmies starin' at? 
		Back to work, goddamn it! 

59	EXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 59

	As before, an object is hauled up the side of the building by
	rope -- only this time, it's a cooler of beer and ice. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		And that's how it came to pass, 
		that on the second-to-last day of 
		the job, the convict crew that 
		tarred the plate factory roof in 
		the spring of '49... 

60	EXT -- ROOF -- SHORTLY LATER (1949) 60

	The cons are taking the sun and drinking beer. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		...wound up sitting in a row at ten 
		o'clock in the morning, drinking icy 
		cold Black Label beer courtesy of 
		the hardest screw that ever walked 
		a turn at Shawshank State Prison. 

				HADLEY 
		Drink up, boys. While it's cold. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		The colossal prick even managed to 
		sound magnanimous. 

	Red knocks back another sip, enjoying the bitter cold on his
	tongue and the warm sun on face. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		We sat and drank with the sun on 
		our shoulders, and felt like free 
		men. We could'a been tarring the 




	roof of one of our own houses. We 
	were the Lords of all Creation. 

	He glances over to Andy squatting apart from the others.

				RED (V.O.) 
		As for Andy, he spent that break 
		hunkered in the shade, a strange 
		little smile on his face, watching 
		us drink his beer. 

				HEYWOOD 
			(approaches with a beer) 
		Here's a cold one, Andy. 

				ANDY 
		No thanks. I gave up drinking. 

	Heywood drifts back to others, giving them a look. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		You could argue he'd done it to 
		curry favor with the guards. Or 
		maybe make a few friends among us 
		cons. Me, I think he did it just to 
		feel normal again...if only for a 
		short while. 

61	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- THE BLEACHERS -- DAY (1949) 61

	Andy and Red play checkers. Red makes his move. 

				RED 
		King me. 

				ANDY 
		Chess. Now there's a game of kings. 
		Civilized...strategic... 

				RED 
		...and totally fuckin' 
		inexplicable. Hate that game. 

				ANDY 
		Maybe you'll let me teach you 
		someday. I've been thinking of 
		getting a board together. 

				RED 
		You come to the right place. I'm 
		the man who can get things. 

				ANDY 
		We might do business on a board. But 
		the pieces, I'd like to carve those 
		myself. One side done in quartz... 
		the opposing side in limestone. 

				RED 
		That'd take you years. 

				ANDY 
		Years I've got. What I don't have 
		are the rocks. Pickings here in the 
		exercise yard are pretty slim. 

				RED 
		How's that rock-hammer workin' out 
		anyway? Scratch your name on your 
		wall yet? 

				ANDY 
			(smiles) 
		Not yet. I suppose I should. 

				RED 
		Andy? I guess we're gettin' to be 
		friends, ain't we? 

				ANDY 
		I suppose we are. 

				RED 
		I ask a question? Why'd you do it? 

				ANDY 
		I'm innocent, remember? Just like 
		everybody else here. 

	Red takes this as a gentle rebuff, keeps playing. 

				ANDY 
		What are you in for, Red? 

				RED 
		Murder. Same as you. 

				ANDY 
		Innocent? 

				RED 
		The only guilty man in Shawshank. 

62	INT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 62

	Andy lies in his bunk after lights out, polishing a fragment 
	of quartz by the light of the moon. He pauses, glancing at 
	all the names scratched in the wall. He rises, makes sure 
	the coast is clear, and starts scratching his name into the 
	cement with his rock-hammer, adding to the record. 

63 	RAY MILLAND 63

	fills the screen in glorious (and scratchy) black & white, 
	suffering a bad case of DT's... 

64	INT -- PRISON AUDITORIUM -- NIGHT (1949) 64

	...while a CONVICT AUDIENCE hoots and catcalls, talking back 
	to the screen. We find Red slouched in a folding chair, 
	watching the movie. Andy enters, backlit by the flickering 
	glare of the projector, and takes a seat next to him. 

				RED 
		Here's the good part. Bugs come out 
		of the walls to get his ass. 

				ANDY 
		I know. I've seen it three times 
		this month already. 

	Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS with 
	him, high-pitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets. 

				ANDY 
		Can we talk business? 

				RED 
		Sure. What do you want? 

				ANDY 
		Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 

				RED 
		No problem. Take a few weeks. 

				ANDY 
		Weeks? 

				RED 
		Don't have her stuffed down my 
		pants this very moment, sorry to 
		say. Relax. What are you so nervous 
		about? She's just a woman. 

	Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, 
	turns back to the movie. 

65	INT -- AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 65

	Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark 
	figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and 
	Pete. Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant 
	bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a 
	door open and drag him into -- 

66 	THE PROJECTION BOOTH 66

	-- where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con
	blinking at them through thick bifocals. 

				BOGS 
		Take a walk. 

				PROJECTIONIST 
		I have to change reels. 

				BOGS 
		I said fuck off. 

	Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams 
	and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. 

				ANDY 
		I know. I've seen it three times 
		this month already. 

	Ray Milland starts SCREAMING. The entire audience SCREAMS witt 
	him, high-pitched and hysterical. Andy fidgets. 

				ANDY 
		Can we talk business? 

				RED 
		Sure. What do you want? 

				ANDY 
		Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? 

				RED 
		No problem. Take a few weeks. 

				ANDY 
		Weeks? 

				RED 
		Don't have her stuffed down my 
		pants this very moment, sorry to 
		say. Relax. What are you so nervous 
		about? She's just a woman. 

	Andy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, 
	turns back to the movie. 

65	INT -- AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 65

	Andy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark 
	figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and 
	Pete. Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant 
	bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a 
	door open and drag him into -- 

66 	THE PROJECTION BOOTH 66

	-- where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con
	blinking at them through thick bifocals. 

				BOGS 
		Take a walk. 

				PROJECTIONIST 
		I have to change reels. 

				BOGS 
		I said fuck off. 

	Terrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams 
	and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. 

				BOGS 
		Ain't you gonna scream? 

	Andy sighs, cocks his head at the projector. 

				ANDY 
		They'd never hear me over that. 
		Let's get this over with. 

	Seemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind 
	bench -- and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel
	of 35mm film. Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others.

				ROOSTER 
		Me first. 

				ANDY 
		Okay. 

	Andy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing
	it into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall. 

				ROOSTER 
		Fuck! Shit! He broke my nose! 

	Andy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his
	knees. Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious 
	eight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it. 

				BOGS 
		Now I'm gonna open my fly, and 
		you're gonna swallow what I give 
		you to swallow. And when you 
		d mine, you gonna swallow 
		Rooster's. You done broke his nose, 
		so he ought to have somethin' to 
		show for it. 

				ANDY 
		Anything you put in my mouth, 
		you're going to lose. 

				BOGS 
		You don't understand. You do that, 
		I'll put all eight inches of this 
		steel ii your ear. 

				ANDY 
		Okay. But you should know that 
		sudden serious brain injury causes 
		the victim to bite down. Hard. 
			(faint smile) 
		In fact, I understand the bite-reflex 
		is so strong the victim's jaws have 
		to be pried open with a crowbar. 

	The Sisters consider this carefully. The film runs out of the 
	projector, flapping on the reel. The screen goes white. 

				BOGS 
		You little fuck. 

	Andy gets a bootheel in the face. The Sisters start kicking 
	and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can 
	get their hands on. In the theater, the convicts are CHANTING 
	AND CLAPPING for the movie to come back on. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's 
		mouth, and neither did his friends. 
		What they did do is beat him within 
		an inch of his life... 

67	INT -- INFIRMARY -- DAY (1949) 67

	Andy lies wrapped in bandages. 

				RED (V.O.) 
		Andy spent a month in traction. 

68	INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT -- DAY (1949) 68

				RED (V.O.) 
		Bogs spent a week in the hole. 

	Bogs sits on bare concrete. The steel door slides open. 

				GUARD 
		Time's up, Bogs. 

69	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 3RD TIER -- DUSK (1949) 69

	Bogs comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette. Not many 
	cons around; the place is virtually deserted. A VOICE 
	echoes dimly over the P.A. system: 

				VOICE (O.S.) 
		Return to your cellblocks for 
		evening count. 

	Bogs enters his cell. Dark in here. He fumbles for the light 
	cord, yanks it. The sudden light reveals Captain Hadley six 
	inches from his face, waiting for him. Mert steps in behind 
	Bogs. hemming him. 

	Before Bogs can even open his mouth to say "what the fuck," 
	Hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar 
	plexus. Bogs doubles over, gagging his wind out.
